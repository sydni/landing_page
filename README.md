##Lab 1: Create a landing page


I added a horizontal navigation bar at the top that changes color when you hover over each option, and when the window is small, changes into a more compact vertical layout. The CREATE button moves down slightly when it is active. The flex-box contains the email address box, while the flex-items contain the lists of links, and these are all contained within one flex-container. When the window is small, the link boxes become vertical and compact, and when you hover over each link heading the associated links appear.
